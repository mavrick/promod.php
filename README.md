Call of Duty 4: ProMod Custom Ruleset Generator

This was an unfinished project that I hope to respark. It was designed to create custom ruleset easily for Promod under the Call of Duty 4 game.

ProMod is a competition mod used in eSports.

The project needs a bit of work and requires a mysql database.

If anyone wants to help out fork away but don't forget to send through those pull requests.

Please keep in mind I wrote this back in like 2008 so the code is old and outdated, it uses mootools 1.0 and very basic PHP but it should still work as is.
